    "Although not everyone wishes to use Starlink generated plots in their papers, it is often helpful to quickly generate images from cubes and maps without converting a file or opening up a new image program. This section shows you how to make a few plots using KAPPA, as either an XWindow which will pop up on your computer, as a PNG or as an EPS appropriate for conversion to PDF. These are then embedded in this jupyter notebook using the jupyter/ipython specific display commands.\n",

    "If you wanted to plot a central spectra you could do this by producing a linplot plot on a pop-up Xwindows device: (NYou have to specify the device every time; this interface may behave strangely if you try and use KAPPA's `gdset` options with XWindows plots.)\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we will set up a different KAPPA style file, so we don't get multicoloured lines on a black background. To set up sensible plotting defaults, we will create a  'kappa_style.def' file, following the instructions at http://www.starlink.ac.uk/docs/sun95.htx/sun95se7.html#x8-620003   We're going to use the shell command `echo` via the magic jupyter notebook commands accessed with `%`"
